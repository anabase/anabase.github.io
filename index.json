Airborne respiratory protection is the key component of airborne precautions.1 Face masks should be prioritized for health care workers in health care settings, or caregivers of confirmed cases, where the cumulative risk of acquiring an infection is highest. Droplet respiratory protection is the key component of of droplet precautions. Face masks should be prioritized for symptomatic (infectious) patients when they are in close contact (within 6 feet) with susceptible persons, especially in a congregate settings such as a health care facility or crowded housing. This is called source control. Face masks do not provide reliable airborne respiratory protection. In the general population, N95 respirators and face masks should be limited to high risk situations based on principles discussed in this article. Respirators and face masks are not a substitute for basic infection prevention practices. CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including:  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.    Introduction Since December, 2019, we are experiencing an epidemic of a novel coronavirus virus (COVID-19) which originated in Wuhan, China, and with the potential to become a global pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and the United States Department of Health and Human Services has declared a Public Health Emergency.\nIn affected areas we see the general public donning face masks, and we are learning about hoarding and shortages of face masks and respirators, even in non-affected areas such as the United States.\nIf shortages of face masks or respirators continue, as a society, we may need to prioritize and direct their use. Our general goals include\nprevent introduction into our community contain community transmission if/when it occurs, mitigate community transmission if infection spreads widely, and screen, diagnose, and treat patients to restore health.  Consequently, to achieve these goals, we focus on (a) mitigating the highest transmission risks, and (b) directing scarce resources to where we expect the greatest benefits.\n Understanding transmission risk Cumulative risk with pictures Imagine two extreme scenarios. First, a health care worker seeing 10 infectious patients (Figure 1). In this scenario, we can see the importance of respiratory protection for the health care worker. For respiratory protection we use respirators (such as N95s or higher) to reduce the cumulative risk of infection.\n  {\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ndigraph circo {\\n\\ngraph [layout = circo]\\n\\nnode [shape = circle,\\n style = filled,\\n color = black,\\n label = \\\"\\\"]\\n\\nnode [fillcolor = white]\\na\\n\\nnode [fillcolor = red]\\nb c d e f g h i j k\\n\\nnode [fillcolor = orange]\\n\\nedge [color = grey]\\n{b c d e f g h i j k} - a\\n}\",\"config\":{\"engine\":\"dot\",\"options\":null}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Figure 1: A susceptible person (e.g., health care worker) in contact with ten infectious sources (e.g., patients)  Second, an infectious patient in contact with 10 susceptible patients in a health care setting (Figure 2). In this scenario, we can see the importance of source control for the susceptible, uninfected patients. In this case, the infectious patient is the source of infection to others and, in a health care setting, may infect many patients. For source control, in addition to isolating the infectious patient, we place a face mask over their nose and mouth.\n  {\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ndigraph circo {\\n\\ngraph [layout = circo]\\n\\nnode [shape = circle,\\n style = filled,\\n color = black,\\n label = \\\"\\\"]\\n\\nnode [fillcolor = red]\\na\\n\\nnode [fillcolor = white]\\nb c d e f g h i j k\\n\\nnode [fillcolor = orange]\\n\\nedge [color = grey]\\na - {b c d e f g h i j k}\\n}\",\"config\":{\"engine\":\"dot\",\"options\":null}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Figure 2: An infectious source (e.g., infectious patient) in contact with ten susceptible, uninfected persons (e.g., patients)  In public health we consider both scenarios simultaneously as part of a comprehensive infection prevention program of which personal protective equipment (PPE) is only one component.2\n Cumulative risk with equations In general, for a susceptible person the cumulative risk of infection, \\(R\\), for a human-to-human transmissible respiratory agent can be represented by\n\\[ R(t) = e^{-\\int_0^t I(u) du} \\]\nwhere \\(I(t)\\) is the infection rate among susceptibles:\n\\[ I(t) = c p P(t), \\]\nand depends on\n \\(c\\), the contact rate and distance with potentially infectious sources, \\(P(t)\\), the probability the source is infectious, and \\(p\\), the transmission probability—the conditional probability of getting infected given contact to an infectious source.  For respiratory infections the definition of meaningful “contact” includes distance between an infectious source and a susceptible host. “Source” is the potential source of infection and often refers to people, but it could be a vector, animal, item, environment, etc.\nThe transmission probability, \\(p\\), depends on infectiousness of the source, susceptibility of the host, mode of transmission, and infection control measures.3\nTo summarize, getting infected—the cumulative risk—depends on\ncontact rate to sources, distance from sources, probability source is infectious, infectiousness of the source (if infected), susceptibility of the host (e.g., no immunity), mode of transmission (droplet vs. airborne), and infection control measures.  Infection control measures include the appropriate use of face masks and respirators. Their benefit is highest when\n they are effective in reducing transmission, the cumulative infection risk is high, the non-infection control risk factors cannot be controlled easily (e.g., many symptomatic patients seeking health care), and the mode of transmission is known.  For these reasons the cumulative infection risk is highest for\nhealth care workers, and close contacts4 of infected persons.  The risk is lowest for the general public that are not having close contact with potential infectious sources.\nTable 1 summarizes the prioritization of face masks and respirators based on risk and benefit.\n Table 1:  Prioritizing face mask and respirator use based on risk and benefit    User Goal Priority Face mask or respirator priority    Infectious patient Source control very high face mask  Person Under Investigation (PUI)5 Source control high face mask  General public (symptoms) Source control medium face mask6  Health care worker Respiratory protection very high respirator (N95 or higher)  Close contact of infectious person(s) Respiratory protection high respirator (N95 or higher)  General public (no symptoms) Respiratory protection low generally not required7     For these reasons, when there is shortage of face masks or respirators, we should prioritize supplies for use by health care workers, caregivers, and patients.\n By far, health care workers and health care settings have the highest risk for infection. Health care workers must wear respirators and symptomatic patients must wear a face mask.\nHealth care workers play a critical role in screening, diagnosing, and treating symptomatic (likely more infectious) patients. Consequently, they are at the highest risk of becoming infected.\nFigure 1 summarizes the key differences between face (“surgical”) masks and N95 respirators.\n  Figure 3: Comparison of face masks to N95 respirators      Appendix: Infection prevention Infection control measures for health care workers include\nplacing face mask on symptomatic patient, and implementing infection control precautions (Table 2).   Table 2:  Infection control precautions in health care setting  Precaution level Description HCW Patient    Standard assumes blood and body substances are infectious Y   Droplet face mask (source control)  Y  Airborne respirator (respiratory protection) Y   Contact gown and gloves Y   Eye protection goggles or face shield Y     Note: For airborne infections (e.g., tuberculosis), N95 respirators are required. For respiratory infections transmitted by large droplets requiring close contact, a face mask may be sufficient in the right setting [1]. However, for novel respiratory agents with increased pathogenicity, even if transmitted primarily by respiratory droplets, a N95 is highly recommended in the health care setting [2].8 In respiratory transmissable infections the size spectrum from large droplets to fine particle aerosols is a continuum (Figure 2). In health care settings where procedures may produce fine particle aerosols, these respiratory infections results in opportunistic aerosol transmission [3].\n  Figure 4: The Aerobiologic Pathway for the transmission of communicable respiratory eisease     Transmission dynamics To learn more about epidemiologic concepts for controlling microbial threats see https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7687z08g.\n  References 1.

Population health is \u0026ldquo;a systems framework for studying and improving the health of populations through collective action and learning.\u0026quot;1 Populations include clinical and community populations (neighborhoods, social networks). Population health data science (PHDS) is \u0026ldquo;the art and science of transforming data into information and actionable knowledge that informs, influences or optimizes decisions2 to protect and improve the health and well-being of populations.\u0026rdquo;\nPHDS rests on the foundation of population health thinking (PHT)3 which is a problem-solving, inferential framework that uses Bayesian networks for\n probabilistic reasoning, causal inference, and decision quality.  PHT supports causal, evidential, and inter-causal reasoning. BNs, and it variants (directed acyclic graphs, decision networks), are used for study design, counterfactuals, deconfounding, decision analysis, and more. R is the ideal programming language to learn PHT/PHDS at an introductory level, supporting public health analysts, practitioners, and researchers to bring additional value to the trans-disciplinary data science table (with computer scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, etc.).\nThe core of population health data science is the timely analysis and synthesis of data using programming and computing power. Fortunately for us we have R! R is a freely available, multi-platform (Linux, Mac OS, Windows, etc.), versatile, and powerful program for statistical computing and graphics (http://www.r-project.org). This course will focus on core basics of organizing, managing, and manipulating population health data; introduction to R programming; and basic R graphics, all applied to PHT/PHDS. Students will complete and present a project in their field of interest.\nPHDS has five analytic domains:\nTable: Population health data science\u0026mdash;Levels of analysis\n   Level Analytic domain Description     1 Description a. surveillance and early detection of events     b. prevalence and incidence of risks and outcomes   2 Prediction a. early prediction and targeting of interventions   3 Explanation4 a. discovery of new causal effects and pathways     b. estimation of intervention effectiveness   4 Simulation a. modeling for epidemiologic or decision insights   5 Optimization a. informing or optimizing decisions, processes, or results    To read more see syllabus (PDF on Dropbox).\n  Aragón TJ and Colfax G.

We are all public health leaders, and embodying and promoting equity is our core value.\nUnless we meaningfully pursue eliminating workplace inequities in all its forms we will be hampered in addressing other inequities, including racial and health. The pursuit of equity starts with honestly acknowledging our workplace power and/or privilege and how, combined with implicit biases, we can unintentionally create, perpetuate, and defend inequities in the workplace.\nFirst, some definitions. Power is the capacity or ability to direct or influence the behavior of others, the course of events, or the allocation of resources. Power comes from positional, moral, or relational authority. Authority is granted by appointment or earned by trust and credibility. It is exercised by embodying universal values (humility, compassion, equity, dignity), or by persuasion, manipulation, or deceit. The dynamics and impacts of power are multi-dimensional, context dependent, cumulative, and can be subtle. For example, the mere presence of a boss can unintentionally shut down subordinates.\nPrivilege is a form of unearned power that comes from social or workplace advantage. All of us have some form of privilege. Privilege exists because of sociopolitical systems and cultural norms that create, reinforce, and amplify power inequities, explicitly or implicitly. For example, in the US, if you are like me: male, heterosexual, cisgender, or have lighter skin color, you have more privilege. You do not choose privilege, but you can acknowledge it, and, more importantly, you can make \u0026ldquo;the noble choice to forgo your status, [and to] use your influence for the good of others before yourself\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;this is humility.\nBiases are preferences, cognitive processes, or inferences that shape our mental models, knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, decisions and behaviors in ways that cause or contribute to inequities in power, opportunities, or outcomes for ourselves and/or others. Biases can be known to you and others (open), known to you and not others (hidden), known to others but not you (blind spot), or not known to you and others (unknown).2\nImplicit (unconscious) biases account for the unknown and blind spot biases, and are the most common and challenging type of bias because we all have them, and they are difficult to identify, measure, and mitigate. Power and/or privilege plus implicit biases can result in unintended inequities. The inequities show up in many ways: race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, social class, religion, job class, funding source, etc.\nWorkplace privilege is a form of unearned power or advantage at work. For example, if I lead or work on a programmatic grant (especially with unspent funds) I may have access to training, travel, and other professional development opportunities not available to non-grant staff. If funding is growing in my area I may have access to new job opportunities. Over years the benefits of these advantages accumulate3 and create or contribute to workplace inequities\u0026mdash;even if we have \u0026ldquo;equality\u0026rdquo; (see Figure). The status quo is defended by rational arguments that leadership (and program and resource allocation decisions) can\u0026mdash;and should\u0026mdash;only come from \u0026ldquo;experts.\u0026rdquo; Consequently, nothing changes.4\n Figure: Equality vs. Equity: Left image: Because we all work under the same explicit rules (we are all issued the same chairs [\"equality\"]), we have the illusion of equity. In fact, because of power, privilege, and bias we have built systems replete with inequities. These generating forces are mostly invisible. We do not recognize that there are many types of privilege that interact with our implicit biases to create, perpetuate, and defend advantage. Without embracing humility, cognitive dissonance blinds us. Right image: We agree: \"We must ensure equity before we can enjoy equality.\" (Source: https://www.getsmartoregon.org/about-smart/equity/)   For supervisor examples: do we treat our staff equitably? Are some staff asked to log their daily job activities in detail, but other staff are not? Are some staff forbidden from merely speaking to peers in other units without prior approval, but other staff are not? For persons with less power or privilege, this treatment feels oppressive or discriminatory, even if unintentional.\nThose are just a few examples\u0026mdash;there are many! Because of cognitive dissonance5 acknowledging our contribution can be difficult, even painful. If we are serious about eliminating racial and health inequities we must also be committed to eliminating all workplace inequities. As an organizational leader, my performance improvement focus is protecting and promoting equity, and eliminating all inequities, including workplace. Our managers will be demanding fairness (equity), transparency, and financial stewardship in how we operate. We want everyone at work to be treated with respect and compassion, and to feel equity and dignity in all aspects of their work.\nFrom readers, I value your active support in eliminating inequities in its many forms. I want you to bring inequities to my attention, including those I create or contribute to. I want you to hold me accountable. We need all of us\u0026mdash;and this includes me\u0026mdash;to acknowledge honestly our privilege (in its many forms) and to make \u0026ldquo;the noble choice to forgo our status, [and to] use our influence for the good of others before ourselves.\u0026rdquo;\nFootnotes   Begun J,Malcolm J.Leading Public Health: A Competency Framework. 1st ed.

Myth: we can learn to read others\u0026rsquo; emotions with reliability. Myth: seeing is believing. Myth: we cannot go wrong trusting our \u0026ldquo;gut\u0026rdquo; feeling.\nReading Lisa Feldman Barrett\u0026rsquo;s How Emotions are Made: The secret life of the brain was transformative. Our emotions, brain, and body do not function as depicted by brain science myths that have been debunked, but persist because scientists, health professionals, and the \u0026ldquo;emotion,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;emotional-intelligence,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;brain science\u0026rdquo; industries are not current with the latest neuroscience. This book will set you on the right course.\nAt birth, the brain is a blank slate awaiting \u0026ldquo;wiring instructions\u0026rdquo; from a caregiver. Every second we are alive the brain processes \u0026ldquo;big data\u0026rdquo; of sensory input from our body (through interoception) and from the external world (through our senses: sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste). Through evolution, humans solved a neurobio-engineering problem: how do we efficiently procure and balance energy and accumulate learnings on how to survive and procreate. The brain evolved into a predictive learning machine. The memories we accumulate through experiences become the predictions (\u0026ldquo;hypotheses\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;priors\u0026rdquo;) that the brain compares to new sensory input (\u0026ldquo;evidence\u0026rdquo;). The gap between prediction and sensory input is prediction error. If the prediction error is small or negligible the brain accepts the prediction, thereby saving cognitive energy expenditure. If the prediction error is large (e.g., cognitive dissonance), the brain must choose either to accept the prediction (cognitively and energy efficient, so our brain strongly prefers this), or to learn (cognitively and energy inefficient, so our brain strongly resists this).\nThe brain must make meaning of this sensory input in order to prepare for what the body needs to do next (based on prior experiences) to survive, etc. The brain prepares the body to respond through our nervous, cardiovascular, immune, endrocrine, and musculoskeletal systems. Emotions are the on-the-spot meanings the brain gives to these external and internal sensory input (bodily sensations). \u0026ldquo;In other words, emotions are your brain\u0026rsquo;s best guess of how you should feel in the moment. Emotions aren\u0026rsquo;t wired into your brain like little circuits; they\u0026rsquo;re made on demand. As a result, you have more control over your emotions than you might think.\u0026quot;1\nAll of this happens automatically at a nonconscious level: that is why it \u0026ldquo;feels\u0026rdquo; like our emotions are \u0026ldquo;triggered.\u0026rdquo; In fact, our emotions are constructed in the moment based on:\n sensory input (from body [interoception] and surroundings [exteroception], includes social environmental context), goal (survive, human drives, etc.), predictions (memories accumulated from prior experiences).2  The implications of understanding this evolution-designed engineering achievement are huge! How the brain processes the big data of sensory input also provides lessons on how we should process the new big data we are accumulating in the \u0026ldquo;cloud.\u0026rdquo; (Hint: read my book review of Judea Pearl\u0026rsquo;s The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect.)\nDesigning an emotionally fulfilling life Even today, we are taught, incorrectly, that emotions are hardwired by evolution and that we should \u0026ldquo;control\u0026rdquo; (i.e., suppress), accept (i.e., embrace), or release emotions. For example, someone or something \u0026ldquo;triggers\u0026rdquo; an emotion and a stress response (\u0026ldquo;fight-flight-freeze\u0026rdquo;) in us, and we can use mindfulness to notice, acknowledge, and \u0026ldquo;release\u0026rdquo; this emotion. Yes, mindfulness works; however, mindfulness is much more powerful when we understand that emotions are acutually constructed rathered than \u0026ldquo;triggered.\u0026quot;\nWe have the power to design and build an emotionally fulfilling life by the experiences we choose to have and the cognitive and motor memories we encode in our brains. This explains how \u0026ldquo;doing\u0026rdquo; rewires the brain! Interestingly, Buddhism3 practices (e.g., mindfulness meditation) align nicely with this modern scientific understanding of brain and emotions. For example, Dr. Barrett studies and describes how Buddhism can strengthen interpersonal relationships and improve your brain and body health.4\nMindfulness promotes stillness, awareness, and being in the moment without judgment or expectation. Then, we can exercise curiosity about what contributed or is contributing to our feelings (affect) and emotions (meaning). This is critical because our brains are quick to draw false conclusions to save cognitive energy rather than to \u0026ldquo;get it right.\u0026rdquo; Interestingly, the more vocabulary we have to describe feelings and emotions, the more ability we have to recognize these in ourselves and others. This is called emotional granularity and is the actual basis of emotional intelligence.5\nDr. Barrett\u0026rsquo;s How Emotions are Made covers many practical applications of this emerging science, including mitigating implicit racial bias.\nKey resources from Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett Dr. Feldman Barrett\u0026rsquo;s book covers a lot of content. To get you oriented, I recommend first watching the three videos below. The first video is 5 minutes, followed by two TED talks by LFB.\n1: This is why you feel the way you feel This is an outstanding 5-minute summary of construction of emotions:\n  2 (TED): You aren\u0026rsquo;t at the mercy of your emotions: Your brain creates them \u0026ldquo;Can you look at someone\u0026rsquo;s face and know what they\u0026rsquo;re feeling? Does everyone experience happiness, sadness and anxiety the same way? What are emotions anyway? For the past 25 years, psychology professor Lisa Feldman Barrett has mapped facial expressions, scanned brains and analyzed hundreds of physiology studies to understand what emotions really are. She shares the results of her exhaustive research\u0026mdash;and explains how we may have more control over our emotions than we think.\u0026rdquo;\n  See reading list for above TED talk.\n3 (TED): Cultivating Wisdom: The Power Of Mood \u0026ldquo;Do you believe that what you see influences how you feel? Actually, the opposite is true: What you feel\u0026mdash;your affect\u0026mdash;influences what you see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. Psychologist and neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett shares the groundbreaking discovery that you experience the world through affect-colored glasses. She also reveals how affect can be a source of wisdom that helps you to make better, wiser choices\u0026rdquo;\n  LFB\u0026rsquo;s website (includes numerous academic lectures) Here is her website with a wealth of material: https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/.\nSlide presentation using LFB\u0026rsquo;s content Principles for designing a healing organization \u0026mdash; A neuroscience and skills-based approach I gave the talk below at the California Conference of Local Health Officers (CCLHO) Semi-Annual Meeting on May 10, 2018.

I am a physician epidemiologist with a doctorate in epidemiology and I teach computational epidemiology (with R) at UC Berkeley. I had the opportunity to study biostatistics from the best professors at UC Berkeley School of Public Health (Steve Selvin, Nicolas Jewell, Richard Brand, and many more). The field of causal inference was just beginning to take off with biostatisticians piloting the plane (Mark van der Laan, Nicolas Jewell, etc.). I avoided a rigorous study of causal inference but eventually came around after studying Bayesian networks (pioneered by Judea Pearl) for decision analysis. Judea Pearl\u0026rsquo;s Bayesian networks and causal graphs connects the fields of statistics, epidemiology, decision and computer sciences in a profoundly elegant way. His work empowers and expands the potential of \u0026ldquo;big data.\u0026rdquo; This is the first book written for the general public on this topic. It will have a huge impact. Causality and causal reasoning is at the core of everything we see, do, and imagine. He provides a graphical tool (causal graphs) for encoding expert knowledge (including community wisdom and experience). Anyone\u0026mdash;yes, anyone\u0026mdash;can learn the basics. For additional rigor, there are structural causal models (functional equations). I now consider it \u0026ldquo;data scientific malpractice\u0026rdquo; to be designing studies, analyzing data, and adjusting for confounders without using causal models. Human brains are wired to resist new paradigms. Be intellectually wise and humble and read this book\u0026ndash;you will not regret it!\u0026rdquo;\nThe Ladder of Causation By the end of this book you will understand, appreciate, and value the \u0026ldquo;Ladder of Causation\u0026rdquo; (Figure below) as a way of thinking about decision making, causal reasoning, and causal discovery. You will develop a different appreciation of the important roles of epidemiology and statistics which have embraced the Causal Revolution.\n Figure: Judea Pearl's \"Ladder of Causation.

A DAG is a Bayesian network where each directed arrow represents a causal link, not merely a probabilistic dependency [3].\nProgram theory has three components:\nTheory of causation (causal model) Theory of change (selected strategy) Theory of action (selected intervention that activates change)  Program theory is often called “theory of change.” We prefer “program theory,” but never forget its three components. Now we review the material with another example.\nIn public health we have two common DAG archetypes [4]: a risk (adverse) event and a benefit (opportunity) event (Figure 1). For both, a trigger is an exposure, condition, activity, or incident that increases the probability of a risk or benefit event. A trigger can be a cumulative process. Before an intervention, these DAGs represent the theory of causation component of program theory.\n  {\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\n digraph ci {\\n rankdir=TB;\\n node [color=black];\\n edge [color=black,arrowhead=vee];\\n subgraph risk {\\n T [label=\\\"Trigger\\\"]\\n R [label=\\\"Risk event\\\"];\\n Con [label=\\\"Consequence\\\"];\\n\\t T - R [weight=10]\\n\\t R - Con [weight=10]\\n }\\n subgraph opp {\\n\\t T2 [label=\\\"Trigger\\\"];\\n\\t R2 [label=\\\"Benefit event\\\"];\\n\\t Con2 [label=\\\"Consequence\\\"];\\n\\t T2 - R2 [weight=10]\\n\\t R2 - Con2 [weight=10]\\n }\\n }\\n\",\"config\":{\"engine\":\"dot\",\"options\":null}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Figure 1: Causal taxonomy for risk event (left) vs. benefit event (right)  Figure 2 depicts the program theory for a public health intervention to reduce automobile crash injuries (a risk event).

Because of a crash. Why was there a crash? Because of fast driving? Why was there fast driving? We cannot answer this question (yet).\nThe program theory is not complete. We must also understand why people drive fast. We have not included the theory of causation from drivers’ perspectives. Suppose, for instructional purposes, Figure 3 represents the most common DAG that explains why drivers speed. Therefore, why was he or she driving fast? To make a meeting. Why was this meeting important? To win a contract? Why was this contract important?

For example, the motivation to drive fast might cancel out the effect of any traditional public health intervention (Figure 2). We must be able to integrate multiple causal pathways reflecting multiple perspectives.\nFigure 4 depicts the unified DAG that integrates driver motivation into a holistic, improved public health program theory. We cannot emphasize enough the importance of building causal graphs from multiple perspectives that include risks and benefits, and different strategy levels. This DAG is a big improvement.\n  {\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\n digraph ci {\\n rankdir=TB;\\n node [color=black];\\n edge [color=black,arrowhead=vee];\\n df [label=\\\"Drive fast\\\"];\\n mm [label=\\\"Make meeting\\\"];\\n wc [label=\\\"Win contract\\\"];\\n cr [label=\\\"Crash\\\"]\\n in [label=\\\"Injury\\\"]\\n nn [label=\\\"Nerves\\\"]\\n P [fillcolor=lightgrey,style=filled,label=\\\"Speed bumps\\\"]\\n Ctrl [fillcolor=lightgrey,style=filled,label=\\\"Automatic breaking\\\"]\\n sb [fillcolor=lightgrey,style=filled,label=\\\"Seat belt\\\"]\\n df - mm - wc\\n df - cr - in\\n cr - mm\\n nn - wc\\n P - df\\n Ctrl - cr\\n sb - in\\n {rank=same; df P}\\n }\\n\",\"config\":{\"engine\":\"dot\",\"options\":null}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Figure 4: Unified causal model that includes driver’s perspective (benefit-seeking) and program theory (risk-reduction)  However, when you review it with subject matter experts they suggest adding “gender” and “age” nodes because both are causally associated with driving fast and wearing seat belts (Figure 5). This will enable you to evaluate the effectiveness of the public health intervention while controlling for the confounding effects of gender and age. For example, if drivers are predominately young males (who drive fast and do not wear seat belts) then the seat belt intervention may appear falsely ineffective.

Conclusive based on good-quality studies and no credible opposing findings;  2. Substantial based on several supportive findings from good-quality studies with few opposing studies;  3. Moderate based on several supportive findings from good- to fair-quality studies with few or no credible opposing findings; a general conclusion can be made, but limitations, including chance, bias, and confounding factors, cannot be ruled out;  4. Limited supportive findings from fair-quality studies or mixed findings with most favoring one conclusion, or no firm conclusions; and  5. None or Insufficient based on mixed findings, a single poor study, or the endpoint has not been studied, with substantial uncertainty attributable to chance, bias, and confounding factors.     Recommendations Recommendation 1: The most effective way to avoid any risks of cannabis use is to abstain from use. Those who decide to use need to recognize that they incur risks of a variety of—acute and long-term—adverse health and social outcomes. These risks will vary in their likelihood and severity with user characteristics, use patterns, and product qualities, and so may not be the same from user to user or use episode to another. [Evidence Grade: None required.]\n Recommendation 2: Early initiation of cannabis use (i.e., most clearly that which begins before age 16 years) is associated with multiple subsequent adverse health and social effects in young adult life. These effects are particularly pronounced in early-onset users who also engage in intensive and frequent use. This may be in part because frequent cannabis use affects the developing brain. Prevention messages should emphasize that, the later cannabis use is initiated, the lower the risks will be for adverse effects on the user’s general health and welfare throughout later life. [Evidence Grade: Substantial.]\n Recommendation 3: High THC-content products are generally associated with higher risks of various (acute and chronic) mental and behavioral problem outcomes. Users should know the nature and composition of the cannabis products that they use, and ideally use cannabis products with low THC content. Given the evidence of CBD’s attenuating effects on some THC-related outcomes, it is advisable to use cannabis containing high CBD:THC ratios. [Evidence Grade: Substantial.]\n Recommendation 4: Recent reviews on synthetic cannabinoids indicate markedly more acute and severe adverse health effects from the use of these products (including instances of death). The use of these products should be avoided. [Evidence Grade: Limited.]\n Recommendation 5: Regular inhalation of combusted cannabis adversely affects respiratory health outcomes. While alternative delivery methods come with their own risks, it is generally preferable to avoid routes of administration that involve smoking combusted cannabis material (e.g., by using vaporizers or edibles). Use of edibles eliminates respiratory risks, but the delayed onset of psychoactive effect may result in the use of larger than intended doses and subsequently increased (mainly acute, e.g., from impairment) adverse effects. [Evidence Grade: Substantial.]\n Recommendation 6: Users should avoid practices such as “deep inhalation,” breath-holding, or the Valsalva maneuver to increase psychoactive ingredient absorption when smoking cannabis, as these practices disproportionately increase the intake of toxic material into the pulmonary system. [Evidence Grade: Limited.]\n Recommendation 7: Frequent or intensive (e.g., daily or near-daily) cannabis use is strongly associated with higher risks of experiencing adverse health and social outcomes related to cannabis use. Users should be aware and vigilant to keep their own cannabis use—and that of friends, peers, or fellow users—occasional (e.g., use only on 1 day/week, weekend use only, etc.) at most. [Evidence Grade: Substantial.]\n Recommendation 8: Driving while impaired from cannabis is associated with an increased risk of involvement in motor-vehicle accidents. It is recommended that users categorically refrain from driving (or operating other machinery or mobility devices) for at least 6 hours after using cannabis. This wait time may need to be longer, depending on the user and the properties of the specific cannabis product used. Besides these behavioral recommendations, users are bound by locally applicable legal limits concerning cannabis impairment and driving. The use of both cannabis and alcohol results in multiply increased impairment and risks for driving, and categorically should be avoided. [Evidence Grade: Substantial.]\n Recommendation 9: There are some populations at probable higher risk for cannabis-related adverse effects who should refrain from using cannabis. These include individuals with predisposition for, or a first-degree family history of, psychosis and substance use disorders, as well as pregnant women (primarily to avoid adverse effects on the fetus or newborn). These recommendations, in part, are based on precautionary principles. [Evidence Grade: Substantial.]\n Recommendation 10: While data are sparse, it is likely that the combination of some of the risk behaviors listed above will magnify the risk of adverse outcomes from cannabis use. For example, early-onset use involving frequent use of high-potency cannabis is likely to disproportionately increase the risks of experiencing acute or chronic problems. Preventing these combined high-risk patterns of use should be avoided by the user and a policy focus. [Evidence Grade: Limited.]\nNote. A detailed rationale for each evidence grade is provided as a supplement to the online version of this article at https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2017.303818a.\n  Footnotes   Problem use (DSM-V) is defined by the following diagnostic criteria: (1) tolerance; (2) withdrawal; (3) craving or a strong desire to use; (4) recurrence use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations (work, school, home); (5) Recurrent use in physically hazardous situations (e.g., driving); (6) Use despite social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by use; (7) taking eh substance or engaging in the behavior in larger amounts or over a longer period than intended; (8) attempts to quit or cut down; (9) time spent seeking or recovering from use; (10) interference with life activities; and (11) use despite negative consequences. Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is mild (meet 2 or 3 criteria), moderate (meet 4 or 5 criteria), or severe (meet 6 or more criteria).↩\n Fischer B, Russell C, Sabioni P, van den Brink W, Le Foll B, Hall W, Rehm J, Room R.

The vast majority of intuitive decisions we make everyday as individuals and as teams are driven by nonconscious mental and emotional processes. Unless we have the courage and humility to learn about, leverage, and mitigate these processes to make better decisions, we will be vulnerable to \u0026ldquo;our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat is a decision?2\n \u0026ldquo;A decision is a choice between two or more alternatives that involves an irrevocable allocation of resources.\u0026rdquo; One of the most important decisions we make daily is how we spend our time. Every commitment of time has an opportunity cost\u0026mdash;the lost benefits of not having chosen a better use of our time.   From science, we know that team deliberative decision-making improves with cognitive diversity and constructive conflict. However, to improve further, we must also understand how we naturally make decisions. It turns out that the vast majority of our daily decisions are made using intuition (our \u0026ldquo;gut\u0026rdquo;). As we will learn, intuitive decision-making is fraught with traps and can lead to poor decisions with high-stake consequences\u0026mdash;even death3\nUnderstanding how cognitive biases affect decisions as individuals and as teams is essential to improving intuitive and deliberative decision-making. In 2002, psychologist Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in Economics, and in 2011 published Thinking, Fast and Slow1 that summarizes his research in cognitive biases and heuristics that effect our judgment, choices, and behaviors. His contributions helped to grow the exciting field of behavioral economics.4\nCognitive biases affect our perceptions, judgments, emotions, decisions, and actions. These biases are sometimes called \u0026ldquo;effects,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;traps,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;pitfalls.\u0026rdquo; Our brain uses two mental processes called System 1 and System 2. System 1 is the fast, automatic, emotional (\u0026ldquo;hot\u0026rdquo;), nonconscious process that drives intuitive (\u0026ldquo;gut\u0026rdquo;) decisions, and System 2 is the slow, reflective, rational, conscious process that enables deliberative decisions. From an evolution lens, System 1 is primitive and based on the principle of \u0026ldquo;What You Sense Is All There Is\u0026rdquo; (WYSIATI). It has the enormous capacity to process data via our senses and automatically respond with a classification and/or an emotion (a physiological response) that is handed off to System 2 for action or further processing (i.e., reflection, deliberation, impulse control, decision-making).\nSystem 1 uses mental models (schemas) that have accumulated over time (e.g., racial stereotypes) and is prone to errors, especially when the data is novel or ambiguous. System 1 is home to our innate processes (human drives, personality traits, emotions, fight-flee-freeze response5), and acquired mental and motor habits, implicit biases, and addictions.\nIn their bestselling book Switch: How to change when change is hard, Chip and Dan Heath popularized System 1 and System 2 using the metaphor of an elephant and a rider (Figure 1).6\n   The rider (System 2) attempts to understand, control, train, and direct the elephant (System 1) (source: https://medium.com/@ptvan).   System 2 is the \u0026ldquo;rider\u0026rdquo; and System 1 is the \u0026ldquo;elephant\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;it never forgets! If the rider had optimal childhood, adolescent, and young adult neurodevelopment, it would exhibit good executive function:\n attention control, emotional regulation, impulse override, and behavioral modification.  Executive function uses working memory, reflection, learning, problem-solving, planning, and strategic decision-making. Fortunately, when executive function is intact and mature, the rider can control and train the elephant, albeit with a lot of effort. An exhausted System 2 (rider) is susceptible to System 1 (elephant) impulses.\n For example, we all know of current national leaders whose gender and racial biases, and inability to focus attention, regulate emotions, override impulses (poor decisions and actions), and modify behaviors, in spite of adverse consequences to self, family, and nation, can all be understood and explained by poor executive function.   We must understand System 1 and System 2 (Table 1) in order to design, deploy, and improve our intuitive and deliberative decision-making, trauma-informed systems, NewSmart and Cultural Humility, change management strategies, trust building, conflict management, and lean management.\nTable 1: Comparison of System 1 versus System 2\n   System 1 (\u0026ldquo;elephant\u0026rdquo;) System 2 (\u0026ldquo;rider\u0026rdquo;)     Nonconscious Conscious   Fast, parallel processing Slow, serial processing   Automatic Controlled   Associative Rules-based (reasoning)   Intuitive (\u0026ldquo;gut\u0026rdquo;) Reflective (deliberative)   Energy efficient Energy hog (exhausting)   Implicit knowledge Explicit knowledge   Not linked to language Linked to language   Uses stored memory (schemas) Uses working memory   Emotional (\u0026ldquo;fight-flee-freeze\u0026rdquo;) Rational    Cognitive biases in decision making From NewSmart Humility we learned about natural human defensiveness from the drive to protect our ego7 and avoid our fears (vulnerability, uncertainty, risk, intellectual or emotional exposure, uninvited scrutiny). Fear (\u0026ldquo;fight-flee-freeze\u0026rdquo; response) is generated by System 1. Now we cover cognitive biases and traps that involve the interaction of System 1 and System 2. Spetzler, et. al have clustered the most important of these into six categories relevant to decision-making (Figure 2). To date, more than 200 cognitive biases have been identified.8\n   Classification of cognitive biases affecting perceptions, judgments, emotions, decisions, and behaviors.   1. Protection of mindset Mindsets are \u0026ldquo;all the stuff in our heads: beliefs, mental models of reality, lessons learned, memories, preferences, prejudices, and unconscious assumptions. We use these to make sense of the world and to make judgments and decisions. Whenever we encounter something that conflicts with our mindset, the first impulse is to reject or attack it, as an antibody would attack an alien organism.\u0026quot;9\nSystem 1 and System 2 team up to protect our mindsets using the following cognitive biases:\n avoiding dissonance, confirmation bias, overconfidence, hindsight bias, self-serving bias, status quo bias, and sunk cost bias.  Whenever we sense data that conflicts with a mindset, we experience a discomfort psychologists call cognitive dissonance. Our mind cannot sustain dissonance; therefore, we mitigate it by ignoring, discrediting, or explaining away the data. Accepting the data would require changing our mindset which is difficult because we seek out data that confirms our mindset (confirmation bias) and we avoid data that challenges it (avoiding dissonance).\nHumans overestimate their capabilities (overconfidence). We are all \u0026ldquo;Monday morning quarterbacks\u0026rdquo; (hindsight bias). We give more weight to our positive qualities than our negative qualities (self-serving bias). We attribute \u0026ldquo;successes to our efforts while writing off failures to bad luck or situational factors.\u0026quot;9\nWith the status quo bias \u0026ldquo;we stubbornly cling to the current position, technology, or \u0026hellip; strategy and for too long\u0026mdash;and even escalate our commitment to it despite evidence that it\u0026rsquo;s not working, in the hopes that things will improve.\u0026quot;9 In a variant, the \\emph{sunk cost bias}, we decide to continue the current course because we have already invested large resources (money, staff, and time) and not because it is the best choice using objective criteria.\n2. Personality and habits \u0026ldquo;Another critical source of decision bias is our collection of habits and the personality characteristics that create them.\u0026quot;9 A habit is a mental and/or motor process that becomes automatic (System 1) and its origin can be from System 1 (nonconscious) or System 2 (through intentional practice). When we are aware of a habit, we can control or change it (System 2) but only with significant effort. Mental habits can influence our decision making.\nPersonality refers to individual differences in characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving.10 Several frameworks exists to explain personality.11 To understand intuitive decisions we use the popular Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality inventory based on Carl G. Jung\u0026rsquo;s theory of psychological types. The MBTI has four binary dimensions:\n Favorite world: Do you prefer to focus on the outer world or on your own inner world? This is called Extraversion (E) or Introversion (I). Information: Do you prefer to focus on the basic information you take in or do you prefer to interpret and add meaning? This is called Sensing (S) or Intuition (N). Decisions: When making decisions, do you prefer to first look at logic and consistency or first look at the people and special circumstances? This is called Thinking (T) or Feeling (F). Structure: In dealing with the outside world, do you prefer to get things decided (\u0026ldquo;convergent\u0026rdquo; thinking) or do you prefer to stay open to new information and options (\u0026ldquo;divergent\u0026rdquo; thinking)? This is called Judging (J) or Perceiving (P).  Figure 3 graphically depicts the four dimensions. For detailed descriptions of each see footnote URL.12\n   Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) inventory.   Extroverts are energized by engaging the outside world (\u0026ldquo;thinking out loud\u0026rdquo;), Introverts are energized by engaging their thoughts. Sensing-types prefer information that is concrete and self-evident. Intuition-types prefer information that is nuanced, conceptual, and high-level. Thinking-types like to make decisions using logical reasoning. Feeling-types like to make decisions focused on people\u0026rsquo;s feelings. Perceiving-types delay decision-making to keep options open and to collect more information. Judging-types accelerate decision-making focused on action over deliberation.\nMBTI captures strong cognitive preferences that drive decisions, behaviors, and habit-formation. Personality type is like being right-handed: we can write with our left hand, but we strongly prefer to write with our right hand. From a self-administered survey, a person will be assigned four letters; for example, ENTJ. Your MBTI changes little over your adult life. Differences in personality-types can lead to poor communication, misunderstanding, and conflict.\nUnderstanding personality-type is critical for (a) understanding that extroverts tend to speak out and get heard, while introverts need time to gather and write ideas; (b) designing communication strategies, taking into account people\u0026rsquo;s preferences for receiving information; (c) understanding our preferences for intuitive decision-making; e.g., decisions made by Thinking-types may come across as cold and heartless (think Mr. Spock!); and (d) designing decision processes that diverge (consider many creative options) and that converge (make a decision), and not get stuck in one personal preference style (i.e., perceiving vs. judging).\nPersonality type can lead to the following cognitive biases: (a) preference-based habits, (b) habitual frames (c) content selectivity bias, and (d) decision styles. Similar to learning how to do things with your dominant hand, your personality will shape your thinking and doing habits (preference-based habits)\u0026mdash;and it\u0026rsquo;s very hard to change! Sensing-types prefer narrow decision frames, and Intuition-types prefer expansive decision frames (habitual frames). Feeling-types are biased toward information about peoples emotions; Thinking-types are biased toward information that is objective and measurable. In decision-making, Extroverts want to openly deliberate and introverts prefer to think and write (decision style). Well designed decision processes engage diverse personality types, ensuring balance and closure (i.e., divergence followed by convergence).\n3. Faulty reasoning System 1 processes raw data using our senses. In contrast, reasoning is a System 2, logical, deliberative process that analyzes data, and manages, synthesizes, and translates knowledge to draw inferences (conclusions), and to inform or influence decision making. The major cognitive threats to sound reasoning are complexity and uncertainty.\nFaulty reasoning due to complexity: Complexity (complex systems) involves entities (people or processes) that are diverse, connected, interdependent, and adapting. Complex systems, especially involving people, are dynamic, ambiguous, and unpredictable. In spite of our best intentions we are susceptible to these cognitive biases: selective attention, inability to combine many cues reliably, substitution heuristic, and order effects,\n\u0026ldquo;The human mind is confused by multi-dimensional problems and loads of data. In response, we often oversimplify. We apply selective attention to the variables that seem most important while ignoring the rest. In situations where many value dimensions are important, we still end up focusing on just a few key attributes because of our inability to combine many cues reliably. We use a substitution heuristic to shift attention from a tough question (\u0026ldquo;How much effort should we spend on this decision?\u0026quot;) to an easier one (\u0026ldquo;How much time do we have before the next executive committee meeting?\u0026quot;), even though the answer to the easier question may have very little to do with the question that we really need to answer. When face with many different pieces of information, another trap, based on \u0026ldquo;order effects\u0026rdquo;, leads us to remember those ideas that are either first or last. In general, when things get complicated, we oversimplify, whether we realize it or not.\u0026quot;9\nFaulty reasoning about uncertainty: \u0026ldquo;Uncertainty\u0026mdash;always an element in big, difficult decisions\u0026mdash;confounds the mind\u0026rsquo;s reasoning capacity. Even highly trained professionals make mistakes when they have to reason through uncertain situations\u0026rdquo;.9 In public health and medicine we use probability theory and Bayes theorem to mitigate confusion about uncertainty. Unfortunately, even for the simplest scenarios, no human brain\u0026rsquo;s System 2 is capable of calculating posterior probabilities given prior probabilities and performance characteristics (e.g., sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests). At a population level intuition was \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo; for evolutionary competition between species; however, today we must reach for System 3\u0026mdash;methods, tools, and experts\u0026mdash;to navigate uncertainty. First and foremost, this requires humility\u0026mdash;NewSmart Humility. We cannot overcome our limitations if we do not acknowledge them and commit to improving.\nTo tackle complexity and uncertainty today we turn to design thinking and data science to analyze, synthesize, simulate, and optimize inputs, outputs, and outcomes; to gain insights that exercise our intuition; and to deliver customer value. No individual has all the expertise and experience for this challenge. Culturally diverse, transdisciplinary teams is the only way to go!\n4. Automatic associations Our nonconscious mind automatically judges data to be more important or probable if they are recent, vivid, readily available, or coherent. The converse is true: data that are not recent, vivid, readily available, or coherent are judged to be less important or probable. This leads to a group of related cognitive biases: (a) ease of recall, (b) availability effects, (c) vividness bias, and (d) narrative fallacy. In the narrative fallacy, a believable good story is judged to be more important or probable, even if it is not.\nIn the halo effect an entity is judged to be important if it is associated with someone or something that is already considered to be important. For example, politicians like to be photographed with popular movie stars or sports figures because of their halo effects.\nWhen we estimate uncertain quantities, our estimate can be influenced, nonconsciously, by exposure to recent, unrelated numerical data (anchoring effects). The greater the uncertainty of the estimate, the greater the anchoring effect bias. Because these automatic associations happened nonconsciously we are completely unaware of these influences.\n5. Relative thinking How we frame an issue effects how our brain perceives it (framing effects). For example, if a doctor informs their patient that a proposed surgery has a 95% chance of survival, the patient will perceive the risk very differently than if the doctor had informed the patient that the proposed surgery has a 5% chance of death. Framing effects are common; however, we cannot predict the magnitude or direction of the effects, so we must run experiments and learn.\nStudies show that people will travel an extra 15 minutes to pay $10 for an item rather than pay $15, saving 30%. However, they are unwilling to travel an extra 15 minutes to pay $100 for an item rather than $105, saving 4.8%. Why? In both cases one can save $5, there should be no difference. But there is, and it\u0026rsquo;s called the reference point effect. Consider how spending an extra $5000 feels when buying $25,000 car versus spending an extra $5000 when buying a $1,000,000 home.\nGoing outside when in freezing temperature and snow feels very different if the context is your winter vacation and you love skiing, or if the context is commuting to work (context effects).\n6. Social influences Humans are social creatures and we want to be liked, valued, and respected. We change our behaviors to \u0026ldquo;fit in\u0026rdquo; (conformity). When we need answers to a problem we are susceptible to accepting suggestions without too much scrutiny (suggestibility), especially if it\u0026rsquo;s from a source we \u0026ldquo;trust.\u0026rdquo; Like rumors, suggestions can quickly spread through a group (cascades). At work, teams are averse to conflict so they \u0026ldquo;go along to get along\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;also known as groupthink.\nMitigating cognitive biases To commit the biases to memory (\u0026ldquo;mindware\u0026rdquo;) remember $\\text{SP}^2\\text{AR}^2$: Social influence, Protection of mindset, Personality and habits, Automatic associations, faulty Reasoning, and Relative effects.

The legalization of adult use cannabis is relatively new in the United States and therefore there is limited and con icting evidence on its public health implications. This report assesses the most up-to-date information and draws together evidence from multiple sources to better understand the potential health impacts associated with cannabis legalization in San Francisco. The report aims to help inform discussions on the legalization process and provide a health lens to more fully understand its implications. This report uses a health impact assessment (HIA) framework to evaluate any potential negative heath impacts or harms to communities from legalization and strategies for their preventions and/or mitigation. The following goals were used to provide an overall structure to guide the project:\n Prevent youth access and exposure to cannabis Minimize potential harms to communities from cannabis use Prevent the renormalization of tobacco product use and reverse of declining use rates Ensure perceptions of cannabis recognize risks associated with use  Based on these goals, the following research question was formulated for the analysis: What are the health impacts of adult use cannabis retailers on San Francisco communities? More specifically, the report wanted to evaluate: How does the density of and proximity to adult use cannabis retailers impact youth exposure and neighborhood quality of life?2 And how does allowing onsite consumption of adult use cannabis impact youth exposure and neighborhood quality of life? For the latter question, evidence in the literature was sparse and key informant feedback was somewhat limited, thus it was not a focal point of the report.\nThis assessment draws together evidence from multiple different data sources to develop a holistic understanding of the health impacts associated with cannabis legalization in order to answer the aforementioned research questions. Data sources included epidemiological data, scientific literature, expert and key informant opinions collected from interviews and focus groups, and diverse quantitative indicators associated with health and the neighborhood environment. These data sources were analyzed for population wide trends and strati ed to examine potential disproportionate impacts of different sub-populations (e.g. by age, race/ethnicity) in following with the goals of the report. Since adult use cannabis in the United States is an emerging industry and there was limited evidence about specialized cannabis services such as onsite consumption.\nRecommendations  Take a measured approach to regulating adult-use cannabis. Implement a robust public educational campaign. Integrate cannabis into youth prevention programming. Address potential disproportionate impacts to communities. Strong regulation of cannabis edibles. Develop advertising standards to protect youth and work to avoid creating social norms.

Transforming organizations and communities requires designing healing and learning organizations, mobilizing and engaging communities, pursuing health equity, and deploying data science\u0026mdash;the art and science of transforming data into actionable knowledge. Transforming complex social systems requires experimentation, learning, innovation, and continuous improvement. At the San Francisco Department of Public Health, Population Health Division we have adopted the population health lean leadership philosophy.1 For a holistic, integrated summary see Figures 2.\n The Leading Population Health Framework (LPHF) is based on a leadership philosophy and three necessary transformations.    The LPHF (Figure 2) is nothing original: it is our synthesis of what we have learned from the ingenuity, grit, and resilience of communities, staff, and colleagues from around the world. At center is the population health lean leadership philosophy to promote and support\n values, mindset, skillset, and toolset, leadership behaviors, people development, scientific problem-solving, daily management, and leading change (especially leader standard work).  The bottom left triangle is transforming self and interpersonal relationships. At center is the core human cognitive-behavioral processes of deciding, acting, and learning. The heart represents the central role of emotions. Radical Transformational Leadership is being, designing, and leading change from the core universal values of humility, dignity, equity, and compassion to transform self, people, systems, and cultures towards equitable and sustainable results (Conscious Full-Spectrum Response [CFSR]).2\nW. Edwards Deming\u0026rsquo;s System of Profound knowledge is the understanding of (a) systems (systems thinking), (b) people (human psychology), (c) variation (statistical thinking), and (d) theory of knowledge creation (i.e., PDSA).\nStrategic intelligence is (a) having foresight, (b) building a shared vision, (c) building effective partnerships, and (d) motivating and inspiring people. At center is the lean leadership philosophy that promotes (a) values and principles (mindset), (b) behaviors, (e) people development, (d) scientific (PDSA) problem-solving, (c) daily management, and (f) leading change.\nThe bottom right triangle is transforming teams and collaboratives. At center is lean thinking. And, the top triangle is transforming organizations and communities. Pioneered in San Francisco, the Community Action Model (CAM) is a community-based participatory approach that changes social policy through youth leadership development and policy action.3\nA NewSmart organization is designed for optimal learning, adaptation, innovation, and continuous improvement by using the following psychological concepts: (a) positivity (promote positive emotions, minimize negative emotions); (b) self-determination theory (promote intrinsic motivation by supporting innate human drives for autonomy, relatedness, and competence); and (c) psychological safety (feeling safe to speak freely; to experiment, fail, and learn; to seek and give constructive feedback; to challenge others\u0026rsquo; thinking, including the \u0026ldquo;boss\u0026rdquo;).\nAt first, Figure 2 may seem overwhelmingly complex\u0026mdash;it is! Instead, start with Figure 1. Try it on for size. When ready, return to Figure 2 and start with \u0026ldquo;transforming self and inter-personal relationships.\u0026rdquo; To \u0026ldquo;be the change you wish to see in the world\u0026rdquo;4 you must commit to lifelong learning, critical self-reflection, and transforming self and interpersonal relationships. Before designing and leading change, we must be open to changing self. Transformation is an iterative journey. While you do not need a road map to take a journey, sometimes it helps.\nPeruse the full document (link below). Experiment. Ask questions. Give us feedback.

The word is thrown around as if everyone understands exactly what we mean. We attend countless meetings where \u0026ldquo;building trust\u0026rdquo; is emphasized. Building and restoring trust requires a thoughtful, systematic approach. To understand trust we must define it precisely. Trust is an aspect of relationships; it varies within and across relationships. Organizational trust researcher, Roger Mayer, defines trust as follows:1\n \u0026ldquo;Trust is the willingness of a party [trustor] to be vulnerable to the actions of another party [trustee] based on the expectation that the other party will perform a particular action important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party. \u0026hellip; Making oneself vulnerable is taking a risk. Trust is not taking a risk per se, but rather it is a willingness to take risk.\u0026rdquo;\n In short, trust is the willingness to be vulnerable to another party. Therefore, trust is a state of readiness to take risk in a relationship. Trust is the willingness to assume risk; behavioral trust (or a trusting action) is the assuming of risk. Our focus is on trust as a state of readiness (\u0026ldquo;willingness\u0026rdquo;). An organizational culture of trust is a culture where staff feel safe to tackle and vigorously debate the most challenging, sensitive topics in service of the organizational purpose.\nNot appreciated by many is that trust is a decision.2 As an intuitive (gut) decision we experience trust as a feeling of safety. As an deliberative decision we experience trust as a feeling of confidence. In short, our objective is to influence others to trust us, our teams, and our organization. Therefore, our job as managers is\n to be trustworthy, to behave in ways that inspire trust, and to design systems that promote a culture of trust.  Building a culture of trust inspires better team collaboration, decision-making, execution, accountability, and performance. Here are The 7 Principles of Building Trust\u0026mdash;these behaviors apply always, with anyone, and in any situation (think \u0026ldquo;C3 HATS\u0026rdquo;):\n C: Have character: honesty, integrity, and loyalty C: Be caring: embody humility and compassion; promote equity and dignity C: Be competent: capable, consistent, and continuously improving H: Be humble: intellectual, cultural, and radical humility A: Be accountable: own your influence; own your mistakes and failures; apologize and make amends T: Be transparent (clarity): communicate intent [what], motive [why], agenda [how: who, where, when], and mutual expectations S: Ensure safety (emotional, cutural, environmental, and physical): respect boundaries; assume good intent; listen deeply without judgment (reflective listening)    The 7 Principles of Building Trust  Cool tip: Fastest way to build trust2\n If you need a foolproof method to accelerate building trust with someone (e.g., your boss as the potential trustor), try this with genuine integrity and humility: \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s really important to me that I earn your trust and confidence. Please tell me exactly what you need from me.\u0026rdquo; Ask for specifics and what success looks like. Write it down and review it with your potential trustor. Confirm mutual goals and expectations. Use the 7 Principles to deliver on your commitment(s).   Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to develop a communication plan to communicate progress, problems, and to manage expectations.3\nDo not confuse trust with confidence. Trusting someone is not equivalent to having confidence in them. Trust requires a risk of vulnerability. A corollary: earning others\u0026rsquo; complete trust almost always earns confidence in you, but earning others\u0026rsquo; confidence (e.g., in your abilities) does not mean they also trust you (i.e., willingness to be vulnerable to your actions).\nThe trustor\u0026rsquo;s propensity to trust is the predisposition or general willingness to trust before any information about the trustee is considered. At one extreme, a very high propensity to trust can result in extending trust even when it is not warranted (\u0026ldquo;blind trust\u0026rdquo;). At the other extreme, a low propensity to trust can result in not extending trust even when it is warranted (\u0026ldquo;blind mistrust\u0026rdquo;).\n\u0026ldquo;Distrust\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;mistrust\u0026rdquo; have roughly the same meaning. Both mean lack of trust. But distrust is lack of trust based on experience or reliable information, while mistrust is often a general sense of unease toward someone or something.\nCourage and trust involve vulnerability Celebrating courage Humility and trust are based in human relationships and involve vulnerability. Brené Brown defines vulnerability \u0026ldquo;as uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Vulnerability is the core of all emotions and feelings. To feel is to be vulnerable.\u0026quot;4 Any time someone risks vulnerability to get better, build trust, protect others, or behave ethically they are courageous! Therefore, we are surrounded by daily acts of unrecognized courage! Recognize and celebrate our courageous staff, clients, and communities!\nUnderstanding empathy and compassion With sympathy I care about your suffering. With empathy I feel your suffering. With compassion I want to relieve your suffering. Be aware and mindful: because of our implicit biases we are more likely to empathize with people \u0026ldquo;like us\u0026rdquo; (e.g., tribalism). Instead, we endeavor to have empathy for those unlike us, and to have compassion towards those who are vulnerable or suffering, and to act in the face of our vulnerabilities\u0026mdash;this is courage.\n #### Footnotes   Mayer RC, Davis JH, Schoorman FD.

Accepting cultural humility means accepting that we can never be fully culturally competent. Cultural humility is the foundation for establishing trust and respectful relationships, and for managing differences and conflict. Cultural humility means\n committing to lifelong learning and critical self-reflection; realizing our power, privileges, and prejudices (biases) (includes conscious and nonconscious [implicit] biases); redressing power imbalances for respectful partnerships; and promoting institutional accountability.  Power is the capacity or ability to direct or influence the behavior of others, the course of events, or the allocation of resources. Power comes from positional, moral, or relational authority. Authority is granted by appointment or earned by trust and credibility. It is exercised by embodying universal values (humility, compassion, equity, dignity), or by persuasion, manipulation, or deceit. The dynamics and impacts of power are multi-dimensional, context dependent, cumulative, and can be subtle. For example, the mere presence of a boss can unintentionally shut down subordinates.\nPrivilege is a form of unearned power that comes from social advantage. All of us have some form of privilege. Privilege exists because of sociopolitical systems and cultural norms that create, reinforce, and amplify power inequities, explicitly or implicitly. For example, in the US, if you are like me: male, heterosexual, cisgender, or have lighter skin color, you have more privilege. You do not choose privilege, but you can acknowledge it, and, more importantly, you can make \u0026ldquo;the noble choice to forgo your status, [and to] use your influence for the good of others before yourself\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash; this is humility.\nFor our purposes, biases are preferences, cognitive processes, or inferences that shape our mental models, knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors in ways that cause or contribute to inequities in power, privilege, opportunities, or outcomes for ourselves and/or others. Biases can be known to you and others (open), known to you and not others (hidden), known to others but not you (blind spot), or not known to you and others (unknown).2\nImplicit biases account for the unknown and blind spot biases, and are the most challenging type of bias because we all have them, and they are difficult to identify, measure, and mitigate. For example, ambiguous hiring criteria are susceptible to implicit biases. Without unambiguous, objective criteria, hiring someone you \u0026ldquo;trust\u0026rdquo; is driven, unintentionally, by implicit biases.2\nCultural Humility video (edited to 6 min)  Cultural Humility video (complete 30 min)  Footnotes   Tervalon M, Murray-Garcia J.
